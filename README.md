===================================================

This repository contains the author's PhD thesis,

> Electron dynamics in complex time and complex space. Emilio Pisanty. PhD Thesis, Imperial College London, 2016. [handle:10044/1/43538](http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/43538).

It contains the main pdf file of the thesis, the TeX and image files used to produce it, and the code and data used to produce the figures.

There are several related resources: 
 - the [Supplementary Information][2], with shiny 3D figures you can view on your browser, and which is also available as a repository [here][3]
 - a self-contained collection of the code and data used, at [Zenodo:61844][4]
 - the software packages [RB-SFA][5], [ARMSupport][6], [QuODD][7] and [EPToolbox][8] used to produce the figures (along with [MaTeX][9], by Szabolcs Horvát)
